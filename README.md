For the intron containing gene Tb927.8.1510 (ATP-dependent RNA helicase DBP2B) the figure plots the genome coverage for the total (TOT), polysomal (POL) and subpolysomal (SUB) samples (1 to 3) of the bloodstream (BS) and procyclic (PC) lifestages. The figure also reports the genome coverage of the Splice Leader (SL) and poly(A) mRNA tails / poly(A) genomic tracts (PA) containing reads assembled from all the samples. Moreover, the figure reports the ribosome profiling reads for the BSF (riboBSF) and PCF (riboPCF) life stages described in Vasquex et al. 2014. Finally, the last two genomic tracks reports the peptide identifications for new predicted open reading frames (PEP-new) and for all the open reading frames (PEP-all). The maximum high of the gene tracks is set and reported on the top left of each genomic track. The top of the figure plots an ideogram of the gene structures. The three grey genomic tracks on the top report ATG codons in green and stop codons in red.
